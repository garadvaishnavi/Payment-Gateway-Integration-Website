# Payment-Gateway-Integration-Website
To add payment gateway feature to the website I have used Paytm Payment Gateway.
This website is a donation website where people can click on donate button and they will be redirected to paytm payment gateway. 
For all this features I have used php as backend. And created this responsive website through bootstrap. 
So to integrate this feature into your website just download the all the files and change the paths included in files according to your file path and you can edit your frontend design in TxnTest.php file.
